/**
 *  Merges segments of approximately equal size, subject to
 *  an allowed number of segments per tier.  This is similar
 *  to {@link LogByteSizeMergePolicy}, except this merge
 *  policy is able to merge non-adjacent segment, and
 *  separates how many segments are merged at once ({@link
 *  #setMaxMergeAtOnce}) from how many segments are allowed
 *  per tier ({@link #setSegmentsPerTier}).  This merge
 *  policy also does not over-merge (i.e. cascade merges). 
 *
 *  <p>For normal merging, this policy first computes a
 *  "budget" of how many segments are allowed to be in the
 *  index.  If the index is over-budget, then the policy
 *  sorts segments by decreasing size (pro-rating by percent
 *  deletes), and then finds the least-cost merge.  Merge
 *  cost is measured by a combination of the "skew" of the
 *  merge (size of largest segment divided by smallest segment),
 *  total merge size and percent deletes reclaimed,
 *  so that merges with lower skew, smaller size
 *  and those reclaiming more deletes, are
 *  favored.
 *
 *  <p>If a merge will produce a segment that's larger than
 *  {@link #setMaxMergedSegmentMB}, then the policy will
 *  merge fewer segments (down to 1 at once, if that one has
 *  deletions) to keep the segment size under budget.
 *      
 *  <p><b>NOTE</b>: this policy freely merges non-adjacent
 *  segments; if this is a problem, use {@link
 *  LogMergePolicy}.
 *
 *  <p><b>NOTE</b>: This policy always merges by byte size
 *  of the segments, always pro-rates by percent deletes,
 *  and does not apply any maximum segment size during
 *  forceMerge (unlike {@link LogByteSizeMergePolicy}).
